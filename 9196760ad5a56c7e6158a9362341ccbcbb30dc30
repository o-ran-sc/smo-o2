      "message": "Hello,\n\nThanks for your first contribution and welcome. I have couple of questions:\n- As this was not clear in the commit message, has the API design work being proposed/endorsed by Nephio? For J-Release, do we have agreement to use OAI Helm charts at https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/cn5g/charts/helm-charts/-/packages\n- Are there plans to create release artifacts? This may be resolved in follow-up patches but right now there are IMHO some unnecessary files, copyright issues (you may get inspired by some work done e.g. in OSC NONRTRIC project). I let open OSC folks including John provide more detailed reviews on the actual code.\n\nThanks again.",
