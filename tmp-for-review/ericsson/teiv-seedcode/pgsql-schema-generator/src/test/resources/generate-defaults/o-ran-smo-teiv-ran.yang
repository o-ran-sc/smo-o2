                    PHY level protocol and real time services. The
                    gNB-CU and the gNB-DU units are connected via

                    The following is true for a gNB-DU:
                    Is connected to the gNB-CU-CP through the F1-C
                    interface.Is connected to the gNB-CU-UP through
                    the F1-U interface. One gNB-DU is connected to only
                    one gNB-CU-CP. One gNB-DU can be connected to
                    multiple gNB-CU-UPs under the control of the same
                    gNB-CU-CP.
                    Note: A gNB may consist of a gNB-CU-CP, multiple
                    gNB-CU-UPs and multiple gNB-DUs. gNB-DU is a concrete
                    class that extends the NG-RAN node object. In Topology, you
                    can create, read, update, and delete the gNB-DU object.";
