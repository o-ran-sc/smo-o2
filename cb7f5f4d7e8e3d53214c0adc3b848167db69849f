      "message": "Thank you for the comment.\nYes, I\u0027d like to discuss O-RAN SC repository policy.\n\nFirst of all, do anyone have plan to re-activate github repository?\nhttps://github.com/o-ran-sc/archived-smo-o2\n\nThen, my concern is that if smo-o2 code is published in github, \"without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work.\"\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository\n\nHow about adding LICENSE file even if it is redundant?\nWhat do you think about it? And is there any issues if LICENSE is redundant?",
