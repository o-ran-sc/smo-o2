Compared to the general framework defined in IETF RFC 7807 [19], the \"status\" and \"detail\" attributes are mandated to be included by the present document, to ensure that the response contains additional textual information about an error. IETF RFC 7807 [19] foresees extensibility of the \"ProblemDetails\" type. It is possible that particular APIs in the present document, or particular implementations, define extensions to define additional attributes that provide more information about the error. The description column only provides some explanation of the meaning to Facilitate understanding of the design. For a full description, see IETF RFC 7807 [19].\n",
